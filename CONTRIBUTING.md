# Contributing

Anyone is welcome to contribute in this library of monitoring templates for Monitoring Studio X!

## Instructions

1. Fork the [sentrysoftware.studioX-templates](//github.com/sentrysoftware/studioX-templates) repository. As a result, you will have your own **studioX-templates** repository in your GitHub account.
2. Create a branch from **master** with a proper name describing the addition or change you intend to bring
3. Commit your changes to this branch, and push this commit to your **studioX-templates** repository on GitHub. The changes must include:
    * A new sub-directory in **./templates** for a new *Template*
    * The template `.CFG` file, as exported from Monitoring Studio X
    * a short **README.md** that explains what the *Templates* monitors and how to configure it (the content of **README.md** is typically the same as the description field of the *Template* object)
4. Submit a *Pull Request* to the [master](//github.com/sentrysoftware/studioX-templates/tree/master) branch of the **sentrysoftware/studioX-templates** repository.

Thank you! :-)
